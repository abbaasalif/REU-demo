# REU-demo
This repo contains information required for following up for the REU site workshop

Please look into the web app folder for web app information. 

For any queries on this raise a issue in github and I will try to address it to the best of my knowledge. 
The code in the web app visualization belongs to Microsoft and Azure just adopting it for workshop demo.
